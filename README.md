# Simple Shop System (backend)

### Description:
- Typescript project (no framework used), Object Oriented Programming.
- Simplified abstraction of a shopping cart, product, and store system.
- The application is a theoretical skeleton - it operates in-memory DB (not integrated with any real DB).
- The application allows for creating products with attributes such as name, price, category, discount, and creating shopping carts containing products, and then finalizing the shopping cart (purchase).
- By expanding this abstraction and adding a DB, the code serves as the basis for a transactional system for an example online store.
- Basic unit tests have been implemented using Mocha/Chai.
